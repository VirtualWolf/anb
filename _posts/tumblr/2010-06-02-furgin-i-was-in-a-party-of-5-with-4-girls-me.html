<p><strong>Furgin:</strong> I was in a party of 5 with 4 girls (me being the only non girl if that wasnt obvious)<br/><strong>Furgin:</strong> we only just did CoT timed because they kept stopping to look in the shop windows<br/><strong>*</strong> Jirra resists the urge to set fire to Furgs, rain an AoE on him then steal his soul and use it to make gobstoppers.<br/><strong>Lolzcat:</strong> i never realised that there were vendors in CoS<br/><strong>Furgin:</strong> Lolzcat: girls can find shoe shops anywhere<br/>*** Furgin was kicked by Jirra</p>
