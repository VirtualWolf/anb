<p><strong>Conniecrashn:</strong> We should support the iPad as a platform for JIRA.</p>
<p><strong>Jirra:</strong> Hmm, I don&rsquo;t know, what resolution does it support?</p>
<p><strong>Conniecrashn:</strong> I don&rsquo;t know. (calls out) Hey Charles, what&rsquo;s the resolution for the iPad?</p>
<p><strong>Carlfish and Furgin, simultaneously:</strong> Closed. Won&rsquo;t Fix.</p>
